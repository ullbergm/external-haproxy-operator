# Runbook: HAProxyClientErrorCount

## Alert
**HAProxyClientErrorCountTotal**

## Description
This alert fires when the number of HAProxy client errors exceeds zero in the last 5 minutes. It indicates that HAProxy has encountered issues communicating with clients, which may impact service availability or reliability.

## Possible Causes
- Network connectivity issues between HAProxy and clients
- Misconfigured HAProxy frontend or backend
- Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, file descriptors)
- Firewall or security group rules blocking client connections
- Application-level errors or timeouts

## Immediate Actions
1. **Check HAProxy logs** for error messages related to client connections.
2. **Verify network connectivity** between HAProxy and its clients.
3. **Inspect HAProxy configuration** for recent changes or misconfigurations.
4. **Check resource usage** on the HAProxy host (CPU, memory, disk, file descriptors).
5. **Review recent deployments or changes** that may have affected HAProxy or its environment.

## Troubleshooting Steps
- Run `kubectl logs <external-haproxy-operator-pod>` or check system logs for error details.
- Use `netstat`, `ss`, or similar tools to inspect open connections and port usage.
- Test connectivity from the operator to the HAProxy node using `curl` or `telnet`.
- Check for dropped packets or firewall denials using `iptables` or cloud provider tools.

## Mitigation
- Restart the HAProxy process or pod if it is unresponsive.
- Roll back recent configuration changes if a misconfiguration is suspected.
- Scale up HAProxy resources if resource exhaustion is detected.
- Update firewall or security group rules to allow necessary traffic.

## Escalation
If the issue persists after following the above steps:
- Escalate to the infrastructure or network team.
- Provide relevant logs, configuration files, and details of recent changes.
